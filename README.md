**Welcome to the N3C Phenotype & Data Acquisition GitHub!**

Our workstream aims to write cohort identification and data extraction scripts against four common data models (OMOP, PCORnet, ACT, and TriNetX) in order to aid sites in submitting data to the N3C central repository.

You’ll find the most recent phenotype [here](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Phenotype_Data_Acquisition/wiki/Latest-Phenotype).

Code for each of the data models is coming soon.

We encourage participation from the community! Please use the GitHub issue tracker to submit any comments or suggestions.
